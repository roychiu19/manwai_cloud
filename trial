GitHub Branching and Merging
Branching and Merging are fundamental version control concepts.
Branching:
allows developers to create separate lines of development, enabling them to work on different features or bug fixes independently.
Developers create branches to make changes without affecting the main branch (often called the "master" or "main" branch).

Merging 
combine the changes made in one branch into another branch, typically merging feature branches into the main branch.
